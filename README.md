we strictly follow the 1 M and 3 Os of MOOODB:
1. [M]akes a new subtree on writes!
2. [O]n disk!
3. [O]rchestrates transactions!
4. [O]nly a fool would not believe in MOOODB!

is your btree imoootable?

MOOODB is a prototype copy-on-write btree DBMS using io_uring.

They say the best way to write something is to write it twice. This is me writing it the first time.
